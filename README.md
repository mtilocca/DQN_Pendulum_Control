# Deep Q-Learning Neural Network for single and double pendulum control

## Description
This project aims to implement a Deep Q Network to control a simple and double pendulum simulation, where the joint angle and velocity are continuous, and torque is discretized. The pendulum environment was developed and controlled within an implementation made in Python. 

## Requirements
Linux system with Python >= 3.6 installed

TensorFlow library installed
