# Deep Q-Learning Neural Network for single and double pendulum control

## Description
This project aims to implement a Deep Q Network to control a simple and double pendulum simulation, where the joint angle and velocity are continuous, and torque is discretized. The pendulum environment was developed and controlled within an implementation made in Python. 

## Requirements
Linux system with Ubuntu 20.04 with Python >= 3.6 installed

- ML library used: 

`TensorFlow`

- ROBOTICS FRAMEWORKS USED: 
From http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/: 

robotpkg-py38-pinocchio 

robotpkg-py38-example-robot-data 

robotpkg-urdfdom

robotpkg-py38-qt5-gepetto-viewer-corba

robotpkg-py38-quadprog 

robotpkg-py38-tsid


## Running setup
Download the repository and run the script DQN.py on the command line.
